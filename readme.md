> Convert a directory of markdown files to structured and usable JSON

## Features
📄 Top level files will turned into an object  
📁 Files contained within top level directories will be grouped into an object  
🗂 Files contained within folders of the collections directory will be turned into an array of objects.  
🐫 File names will be transformed to [camelCase](https://github.com/sindresorhus/camelcase) and used as property names  
✍️ Markdown will be parsed as HTML using [Metalsmith Markdown](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith-markdown) and output within a `contents` property.  
🕹 Frontmatter will be added as properties of the generated objects.

## Install

```console
$ npm install jdown
```

## Usage

```js
const jdown = require('jdown');
jdown('path/to/markdown/content').then(content => console.log(content));
```

Where "path/to/markdown/content" is a directory containing markdown files or folders as described under the "Features" header above. The file path will be relative to the project root so if your content was in /Users/username/project/src/content, you would use `jdown('src/content')`.

Use the generated JSON however you like, I recommend with a static site generator like [React Static](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static)! This way you can use the markdown files as a CMS and use the JSON in the build stage.

## Examples

See the [examples](example/) directory of this repository. To test it yourself clone this repo, install the dependancies with `npm install`, modify some content and run `npm run example`.

[danwebb.co](https://danwebb.co) is built using jdown and [React Static](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static) so see the static.config.js file in the [websites github repo](https://github.com/DanWebb/danwebb.co) for a real world example.

There is also an example built into React Static that you can use to quickly get up and running  [here](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static/tree/master/examples/markdown).
